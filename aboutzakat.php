    <p>Zakat is one of the five pillars of Islam and is an obligatory act of charity for financially-able Muslims. The term zakat means "purification" and refers to the purification of one's wealth by giving a certain percentage of it to those in need. The amount of zakat is usually 2.5% of a Muslim's total wealth, including money, property, and other assets.</p>
    <p>The recipients of zakat include the poor, needy, and those in debt, as well as people working to establish and promote Islam, such as scholars and converts. Zakat can be given in various forms, such as cash, livestock, crops, or other goods. It is important to note that zakat is not the same as sadaqah, which is voluntary giving above and beyond the obligation of zakat.</p>
    <p>Zakat is not just a means of helping the poor but also serves as a way to purify one's wealth and to promote social welfare. By giving zakat, Muslims show their solidarity with the less fortunate and help to alleviate poverty and promote social justice. Zakat can be distributed directly to those in need or through established channels, such as mosques or charitable organizations.</p>
    <p>In Islam, zakat is considered to be an act of worship, and Muslims who fulfill this obligation hope to gain spiritual rewards and blessings from Allah. It is recommended that zakat be given during the month of Ramadan, although it can be given at any time throughout the year.</p>
    <p>Overall, zakat is an important aspect of Islam that serves to promote social welfare and compassion for the less fortunate. It is a way for Muslims to fulfill their religious duty and to gain spiritual rewards while also contributing to the betterment of society as a whole.</p>
